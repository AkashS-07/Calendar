# 📅 Custom Event Calendar (Next.js)

A feature-rich, interactive calendar that allows users to **add**, **edit**, **delete**, and manage **recurring events** — with **drag-and-drop rescheduling**, **event persistence**, and **responsive UI**.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the calendar by modifying files in the `app/` directory (e.g., `app/page.tsx` or `app/calendar/page.tsx`).
The page auto-updates as you edit the files.
